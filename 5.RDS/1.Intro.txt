=> RDS(Relational Database Sevice):
-----------------------------------
-> It is a managed database service designed for databases that use sql as their query language.
-> SQL is a structured language widely used across many database engines.
-> With amazon RDS we can create database in the cloud managed by aws.

=> Supported Database engines:
------------------------------
-> Amazon RDS supports several database engines including:
1> PostgreSQL
2> MySQL
3> MariaDB
4> Oracle
5> Microsoft SQL Server
6> IBM DB2
7> Aurora (a proprietary AWS database engine that will be studied in depth)

=> Why Use Amazon RDS Instead of Self-Managed Databases?
--------------------------------------------------------
-> While it is possible to deploy your own database service on an EC2 instance, Amazon RDS offers a fully managed 
    service with many advantages:
1> Automated provisioning of the database.
2> Automated operating system patching.
3> Continuous backups with the ability to restore to a specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)
4> Monitoring dashboards to view database performance
5> Support for read replicas to improve read performance
6> Multi-AZ deployments for disaster recovery
7> Maintenance windows for upgrades
8> Scaling capabilities both vertically (increasing instance type) and horizontally (adding read replicas)
9> Storage backed by Elastic Block Store (EBS)

Note: One limitation is that you can't SSH into the underlying RDS instances, as aws manage the infrastructure.
      This is not a disadvantage because it removes the need to manage the underlying EC2 instances yourself.

=> RDS Storage Auto Scaling:
----------------------------
-> A notable feature of Amazon RDS is Storage Auto Scaling.
-> When creating an RDS database, you specify the initial storage size, for example, 20 gigabytes.
-> If your database usage increases and you approach the allocated storage limit, RDS can automatically scale the 
   storage without any manual intervention or downtime.
-> This feature is especially useful for applications with unpredictable workloads. as it prevents running out of storage
   space and the need to manually increase storage.

=> To use Storage Auto Scaling, you must set a maximum storage threshold to prevent unlimited growth. The storage will 
   automatically increase if the following conditions are met:
1> Free storage is less than 10% of the allocated storage.
2> The low storage condition has persisted for more than five minutes.
3> At least six hours have passed since the last storage modification

=> Conclusion:
-> Amazon RDS provides a robust, managed relational database service with automation for provisioning, maintenance, 
   scaling, and backups. Its Storage Auto Scaling feature enhances flexibility for applications with variable workloads. 
   While direct access to the underlying instances is not provided, the managed nature of RDS simplifies database operations
   significantly.

=> Key Takeaways:
------------------
-> Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service supporting multiple SQL engines.
-> RDS automates provisioning, patching, backups, monitoring, and scaling.
-> Storage Auto Scaling allows automatic increase of storage based on usage thresholds.
-> RDS does not provide SSH access to underlying instances, emphasizing its managed nature.
