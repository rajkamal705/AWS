=> RDS Read replicas:
---------------------
-> Read replicas, as the name indicates, help you to scale your read operations.
-> Consider an application connected to an RDS database instance that performs both reads and writes.
-> When the main database instance cannot scale enough due to too many requests, you can create up to 15 Read Replicas.
-> These replicas can be within the same availability zone, across availability zones, or even across regions.

-> Purpose: Scale read operations (make reading from the database faster by adding more copies).
-> You can create up to 15 Read Replicas.
-> Deplyment Options: 1> Same Availability Zone (AZ) 2> Different AZ in the same region 3> Different AWS Region (cross-region)
-> Replication is asynchronous → data is eventually consistent : This means a Read Replica may not have the very latest data
   immediately after a write.
-> Good for heavy read workloads (like reports, analytics).
-> Can be promoted to a standalone database (can then do writes).
-> Application must update connection strings to use the replicas.
-> Only SELECT queries are allowed on Read Replicas (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
-> Cost: 
       1> Replication traffic between AZs in the same region → Free.
       2> Replication traffic across regions → Charged.

=> Example use case:
----------------------
-> Your main database handles both reads and writes.
-> A reporting team wants to run heavy queries.
-> Instead of connecting them to the main DB (which may slow it down), you create a Read Replica.
-> The reporting team reads from the replica so the main app is unaffected.


=> RDS Multi AZ:
----------------
-> Purpose: Disaster recovery & high availability, not scaling.
-> Setup:
   - Master DB in one AZ.
   - Standby DB in another AZ.
-> Replication is synchronous: standby always has the same data as master.
-> The application uses one DNS name to connect.
-> If the master fails: 
   1> AWS automatically fails over to standby.
   2> Application reconnects automatically (same DNS).
-> Standby DB cannot be read from or written to during normal operations.
-> Protects against:
   1> AZ failures
   2> Network issues
   3> Instance or storage failures

=> Combining Both
-----------------
-> You can make Read Replicas that are also Multi-AZ for both scaling reads and disaster recovery.

=> Switching from Single-AZ to Multi-AZ:
-----------------------------------------
-> No downtime.
-> Steps AWS takes automatically:
   1> Take a snapshot of the main DB.
   2> Restore it in a new standby DB in another AZ.
   3> Synchronize both databases.
-> Once sync is done, Multi-AZ is ready.


=> Key Differences:
--------------------
=> | Feature            | Read Replicas        | Multi-AZ          |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------- |
| Purpose            | Scale reads          | Disaster recovery |
| Replication type   | Asynchronous         | Synchronous       |
| Can be read from   | Yes                  | No                |
| Can be written to  | No (unless promoted) | No                |
| Scaling benefit    | Yes                  | No                |
| Automatic failover | No                   | Yes               |
| Max replicas       | 15                   | 1 standby         |
