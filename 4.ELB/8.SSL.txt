=> SSL(Secure Socket Layer) /TLS (Transport Layer Security):
------------------------------------------------------------
-> SSL and TSL are way to encrypt data sent over internet.
-> This encryption make sure that nobody can see what you're sending and reciving(Like msg, password etc).
-> TLS is newer and more secure

Q> What is an SSL Certificate?
------------------------------
-> An SSL is like identity card for websites, that helps browser know the site is safe.
-> It’s issued by trusted companies called Certificate Authorities (like GoDaddy, DigiCert, or Let’s Encrypt).
-> when a website has a valid certificate, you see a lock 🔒 sign in browser.

=> Do SSL Certificates Expire?
-> Yes. Just like a driver’s license, they expire and must be renewed regularly to keep the website trusted and secure.

=> SSL with Load Balancers:
---------------------------
-> A load balancer is like a traffic director for your website that decides which server will handle a request.

=> Here's how SSL works with it:
--------------------------------
1> Clients (users) connect to your site using HTTPS (which uses SSL/TLS).
2> The load balancer decrypts this secure traffic (called SSL termination).
3> After decrypting, it can send the request to your servers over plain HTTP (inside your private network, which is still safe).

=> What is ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)?
------------------------------------------
-> In AWS, you can use ACM to manage SSL certificates.
-> You can also upload your own certificates if needed

=> What is SNI (Server Name Indication)?
----------------------------------------
-> Problem: You want to host multiple websites (like site1.com and site2.com) on one load balancer. But each site 
   needs its own SSL certificate.
-> Solution: SNI allows the browser to tell the server which domain it's trying to reach right at the start.
-> Then the load balancer picks the right SSL certificate to use for that domain.
Ex: If someone calls a hotel and says they’re meeting “Mr. Smith,” the receptionist knows which room to connect them to.

=> How SNI works with ALB:
---------------------------
1> Imagine ALB has two sites:
👉 www.mycorp.com
👉 domain1.example.com
2> Each has its own SSL certificate.
3> When a client visits one of these, ALB uses SNI to figure out which domain is being requested.
4> Then it picks the correct SSL certificate and sends the traffic to the correct server (target group).

=> Which Load balancer support what:
--------------------------------------
| Load Balancer Type                  | SSL Certificate Support       | SNI Support |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Classic Load Balancer**           | Only 1 SSL certificate per LB | ❌ No        |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Multiple certificates via SNI | ✅ Yes       |
| **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**     | Multiple certificates via SNI | ✅ Yes       |


=> Summary:
-----------
-> SSL/TLS: Encrypts your internet traffic so it’s secure.
-> Certificates: Prove your website is safe and encrypt data.
-> Load balancers: Manage traffic and can decrypt SSL traffic.
-> SNI: Lets one load balancer use different SSL certificates for different websites.
-> Use ALB or NLB if you need to support multiple domains with HTTPS.
