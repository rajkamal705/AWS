=> GWLB(Gateway Load Balancer):
-------------------------------
-> GWLB is a special kind of AWS load balancer used to inspect and control network traffic.
-> It helps you add security appliances like firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention system, or deep packet inspection
   systems, payload manipulation etc.

Q> why use GWLB?
-> when you want all traffic to be filtered or checked before reaching your application.
-> Useful for security, traffic monitoring, or modifying network packets.
-> Helps you insert third-party security tools into your AWS traffic flow.

=> How traffic normally flow(Without GWLB):
-------------------------------------------
-> User -> ALB -> Application (like EC2, lambda, etc.)
-> No filtering or inspection - traffic goes straight to your app

=> How traffic flows with GWLB:
-------------------------------
1> User sends request.
2> GWLB recives traffic first.
3> GWLB sends traffic to virtual applicances like firewalls, etc.
4> Applicances inspect or modify the service.
5> if it's safe traffic returned to GWLB.
6> GWLB forwards it to your actual application.
Note: This happens without your app knowing - it's transparent.

=> GWLB works at Layer 3(Network Layer):
----------------------------------------
-> Lower level than ALB(Layer 7) and NLB(Layer 4):
-> It works with IP packets, not just HTTP or TCP.
-> Uses GENEVE protocol on port 6081 to encapsulate traffic(wrap it in a secure shell for inspection).

=> GWLB Target Groups:
----------------------
-> These are the security appliances that inspect traffic.
-> Can be:
   1> EC2 instances (registered by ID),
   2> Or private IP addresses (like on-prem servers).
-> These appliances must be ready to process and forward traffic.

=> Why It's Useful:
---------------------
-> Makes it easier to insert security and monitoring into your AWS network.
-> You don’t have to manually route or manage inspection logic.
-> Scales automatically with traffic using load balancing.

=> Things to Keep in Mind:
--------------------------
-> Setting up GWLB is complex and usually done by advanced users or vendors.
-> Most AWS users just need to understand how it works, not how to build it from scratch.
-> You won't need to configure it manually for exams or simple projects.

| Feature          | Simplified Explanation                                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**      | To send all network traffic through security tools like firewalls |
| **Traffic Path** | User → GWLB → Security Appliance → GWLB → App                     |
| **Layer**        | Works at Layer 3 (IP packet level)                                |
| **Protocol**     | Uses GENEVE protocol on port 6081                                 |
| **Target Group** | Virtual appliances (EC2 or private IPs)                           |
| **Use Cases**    | Firewalls, intrusion detection, packet inspection                 |
| **Transparency** | Your app doesn't know traffic is being filtered                   |
