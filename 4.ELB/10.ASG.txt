=> ASG(Auto Scaling Group):
---------------------------
-> when you run a website or app, the number of visitors can change during the day.
-> In AWS, you can create or remove EC2 instances quickly using the API.
-> Instead of doing it manually, AWS gives you Auto Scaling Groups to automate this process.
-> ASGs can:
   1> Scale out → Add more EC2 instances when traffic increases.
   2> Scale in → Remove EC2 instances when traffic decreases.
-> The number of EC2 instances in the ASG changes over time.
-> You can set:
   1> Minimum number of instances → never go below this.
   2> Maximum number of instances → never go above this.
-> ASG itself is free — you only pay for the EC2 instances it launches.

=> ASG Capacity Settings:
--------------------------
-> When creating an ASG, you set:
1> Minimum capacity – Lowest number of EC2 instances (e.g., 2).
2> Desired capacity – The target number of instances you want right now (e.g., 4).
3> Maximum capacity – The highest number allowed (e.g., 7).
Note: If your desired capacity goes up (but stays below the max), ASG automatically adds EC2 instances.

=> ASG + Load Balancers
-------------------------
-> ASGs often work with an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
-> Example:
-> If 4 instances are in the ASG, the ELB sends user traffic to all 4 instances.
-> The ELB runs health checks on instances.
-> If one instance is unhealthy, ASG terminates it and launches a new one.
-> When new EC2 instances are added, the ELB starts sending them traffic too.
-> This combo (ASG + ELB) ensures:
   1> Even load distribution.
   2> Automatic replacement of broken instances.

=> Launch template and ASG setup:
---------------------------------
-> To create an ASG, you need a launch template(old launch configurations are no longer used).
-> A Launch Template contains all the details needed to start an EC2 instance:
   - AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
   - Instance type
   - EC2 user data script
   - EBS volumes
   - Security groups
   - SSH key pair
   - IAM roles for EC2
   - Network & subnet info
   - Load balancer info

-> You also configure:
   - Minimum size
   - Maximum size
   - Initial capacity
   - Scaling policies

=> Scaling Policies & CloudWatch Alarms
----------------------------------------
-> ASG can automatically add or remove instances based on CloudWatch alarms.
-> CloudWatch monitors metrics (like CPU usage) and triggers alarms.
-> ASG has 3 instances:
   1> CloudWatch alarm says CPU usage is too high.
   2> ASG scales out → adds more EC2 instances automatically.
   3> If CPU usage drops too low, ASG scales in → removes some instances.

-> You can create:
   - Scale-out policies → add instances.
   - Scale-in policies → remove instances.

=> Summary:
-----------
-> Auto Scaling Groups automatically change the number of EC2 instances based on load.
-> They add instances when traffic increases (scale out) and remove them when traffic drops (scale in).
-> They work with minimum and maximum limits you set.
-> When combined with a load balancer, ASG:
   - Spreads traffic evenly.
   - Replaces unhealthy instances automatically.
-> Scaling actions are triggered by CloudWatch alarms based on metrics like CPU usage.
