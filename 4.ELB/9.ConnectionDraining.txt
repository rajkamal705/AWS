=> Connection Draining:
------------------------
-> It's feature used in ELB to allow servers(EC2 instances) to finish their ongoing work before being removed.
-> It ensures that, users don't get disconnected in the middle of request(like during a file upload or payment).

=> Different Names based on load balancer type:
-> For Classic Load Balancers, it is called Connection Draining.
-> For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, it is referred to as Deregistration Delay.

=> Why is it needed?
-> when you remove or replace an EC2 instance, it might still be handling user request.
-> If you stop it suddenly, users could face errors, dropped connections, or incomplete transactions.
-> Connection Draining gives the instance time to finish its current work before shutting down.

=> How it works?
-> Imagine you have 3 EC2 instances behind a load balancer.
-> One instance is set to draining mode (being removed or marked unhealthy).
-> Here's what happens:
1> ELB stops sending new users to the draining instance.
2> The draining instance is still allowed to finish active requests from users already connected to it.
3> After those requests are done or the draining time expires, the instance is fully removed.
4> Meanwhile, new user requests are only sent to the other healthy instances.

=> Draining Time Configuration:
-------------------------------
-> You can set the draining period (how long the instance waits before shutdown).
-> Valid values: 1 to 3,600 seconds (thatâ€™s up to 1 hour).
-> Default value: 300 seconds (5 minutes).
-> Disable draining: Set the value to 0 seconds (the instance is removed immediately with no waiting).

Q> When to use low or high draining time.
-----------------------------------------
1> Short Requests (like API calls):
   -> Use a low value like 30 seconds.
   -> This helps in quickly removing instances without keeping them online too long.

2> Long Requests (like file uploads, video processing, long sessions):
   -> Use a higher value like 300+ seconds.
   -> This gives enough time to gracefully finish these longer tasks.

=> Summary:
-----------
-> Connection draining: Gracefull shutdown of EC2 instances behind load balancer.
-> It prevents cutting off active user connection.
-> It's called:
   1> "Connection Draining" in Classic Load Balancer.
   2> "Deregistration Delay" in ALB and NLB.
-> Draining time is configurable (1 to 3600 seconds). Default is 300 seconds.
-> Use short draining times for short requests and longer times for long-running ones.
