=> ALB(Application Load Balancer V2):
------------------------------------
1> works at layer 7(Http/ https):
-> ALB operates at the application layer of OSI model.
-> It makes decision based on content like URLs, headers, hostname, query string -> perfect for web apps.

2> Distribute traffic to multiple HTTP applications across diff servers:
-> you can route traffic to different backend serers(target groups) based on rules.
-> For example, requests to /api go to one group, and /images go to another.

3> can handle multiple apps on the same machine:
-> ALB can route traffic to different ports on the same server.
-> For example, if you have two apps on the same EC2 instance — one on port 3000 and another on port 4000 — ALB can route 
   traffic to each correctly.

4> Supports HTTP/2 and WebSockets:
-> HTTP/2: Faster, more efficient loading.
-> WebSockets: For real-time communication like chat apps or live dashboards.

5> Routing features:
1> Path based routing: 
-> /users goes to one app, /posts to another.

2> Host-based routing:
-> api.example.com vs blog.example.com → different targets.

3> Query string & header-based routing
-> ?platform=mobile vs ?platform=desktop.

6>  Target Groups:
-> ALB sends traffic to target groups, which can include:
1> EC2 instances
2> ECS tasks
3> Lambda functions (for serverless apps)
4> Private IPs (e.g., on-prem servers)
-> ALB uses health checks to monitor which targets are working.

=> Extra features:
-------------------
-> ALB gives a fixed DNS hostname (like Classic Load Balancer).
-> The application server don't see the IP of the client directly:
   1> The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For.
   2> we can also get Port(X-Forwarded-port)
   3> X-Forwarded-Proto → Protocol used (HTTP/HTTPS)

=> Notes:
---------
-> ALB is ideal for modern web apps using microservices, ECS, and serverless.
-> It is more flexible than Classic Load Balancer, especially for multiple apps behind a single entry point.


=> Practice:
-------------
-> we can set our instance to not direcly access using public IP after adding in target groups and attached to load balancer.
-> we can make the security group of the instance to attached with security group of load balancer.
-> then instances will be allowed to access only using load balancer DNS link.

-> we can also add rules in our load balancer using listener rules.
