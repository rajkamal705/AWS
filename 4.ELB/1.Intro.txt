=> Scalability means that your application system can handle a greater load by distributing your system load.
1> vertical Scalability
2> Horizonatal Scalability

1> vertical Scalability:
------------------------
-> vertical Scalability means increasing the size or capacity of your instance.
-> Ex: suppose our EC2 instance is running on t2.micro, on increasing load, we can shift it to t2.large. This is vertical Scalability.
-> vertical Scalability is commonly used for non distributed system like database.
-> services like RDS or Elastic cache allow vertical scalling by upgrading the underlying instance types.

2> Horizonatal Scalability:
--------------------------
-> Horizonatal scaling means increasing the number of instances or systems for your application.
-> Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems and is common in web or modern applications. However, not every 
   application can be distributed.

=> Scalability and High Availability in AWS
----------------------------------------------
-> In AWS terms:
1> Vertical scaling involves increasing instance size, scaling up or down. For example, the smallest instance is t2.nano 
   with 0.5 GB RAM and 1 vCPU, while the largest is a u-12tb1.metal with 12.3 TB RAM and 450 vCPUs.

2> Horizontal scaling involves increasing or decreasing the number of instances, called scale out or scale in respectively. 
   This is used with auto scaling groups or load balancers.

3> High availability involves running the same application instance across multiple availability zones, enabled in auto 
   scaling groups or load balancers.

=> Key Takeaways:
-------------------
-> Scalability enables an application system to handle greater load by adapting, either vertically or horizontally.
-> Vertical scalability involves increasing the size or capacity of a single instance, such as upgrading a server or operator.
-> Horizontal scalability involves increasing the number of instances or systems, commonly used in distributed systems.
-> High availability ensures system operation across multiple data centers or availability zones to survive failures, 
   often linked with horizontal scaling.
