=> VPC(virtual private cloud):
------------------------------
-> Think of it as your own private network inside AWS.
-> It is regional → every AWS region has its own VPC.

=> Subnets inside VPC:
----------------------
-> subnets are smaller section inside a VPC.
-> They are created at the availability zone level.
-> Two types of subnets:
   1> public subnet: Connected to the internet(can send and receive traffic).
   2> private subnet: Not directly connected to the internet(no direct access from outside).

=> Route Tables:
----------------
-> This decide, how traffic move between subnets and the internet.
Ex: 
-> Public subnet has a route to the internet.
-> Private subnet has no direct route to the internet (only internal communication).

=> VPC Architecture:
--------------------
1> CIDR Range:
- The VPC has a set of IP ranges called a CIDR range, which defines the allowed IP addresses within your VPC.

2> Across availability zone:
- Usually, companies use multiple AZs for high availability.
- In each AZ you can have both public and private subnets.
- you can launch EC2 instances in any subnet you choose.

3> Default VPC:
- AWS creates a default VPC in every region for you.
- By default, it has only public subnets (no private subnets).

=> Internet Gateways(IGW) and NAT Gateways
------------------------------------------
1> Internet Gateway(IGW):
- A door that connects your VPC to the internet.
- If subnet has a route to IGW - it becomes public subnet.
- Example: EC2 in public subnet → can directly access the internet and can also be accessed from the internet.

2> Private Subnet Problem:
- EC2 in a private subnet cannot directly access the internet.
- But sometimes, it still needs internet (e.g., for updates).
- We want outbound access only, not inbound.

3> NAT (Network Address Translation):
- Solution for private subnets to access the internet securely.
- Two Options:
  1> NAT Gateway: AWS-managed (scales automatically, less work for you).
  2> NAT Instance: Self managed EC2 instance acting as NAT(more control, but you manage scaling/updates).

4> How NAT Works:
- The NAT Gateway or NAT instance is deployed in a public subnet.
- Then, a route is created from the private subnet to the NAT Gateway or instance
- Since the NAT resides in the public subnet, it has a route to the Internet Gateway.
- Therefore, private subnets can access the internet through the NAT, maintaining their privacy.

=> Key Takeaways:
------------------
- A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a private network within the AWS cloud that allows resource deployment and is regional.
- Subnets partition a VPC at the availability zone level and can be public (internet accessible) or private (not internet accessible).
- Route tables define network traffic flow between subnets and to the internet.
- Internet Gateways enable public subnets to access the internet, while NAT Gateways allow private subnets to access the internet securely without inbound internet access.
