=> NACL (Network Access Control List):
-------------------------------------
- Acts as firewall at subnet level.
- Controls traffic in and out of subnets.
- Supports both Allow and Deny rules.
- Rules are based on IP addresses only.
- Stateless → must allow both inbound and outbound separately.
- Example: You can block traffic from a specific IP range at subnet level.
- Default VPC → comes with a default NACL that allows all inbound and outbound traffic.

=> Security Groups (SG):
-------------------------
- Acts as a firewall at the instance/ENI (Elastic Network Interface) level.
- Controls traffic directly to EC2 instances.
- Supports only Allow rules (no deny).
- Rules can reference IP addresses or other Security Groups.
- Stateful → if inbound traffic is allowed, return traffic is automatically allowed (and vice versa).
- Provides the second layer of defense (after NACL).

=> NACL vs Security Group (Quick Comparison):
---------------------------------------------
1> Attachment level:
   - NACL → Subnet level.
   - SG → Instance/ENI level.
2> Rule Types:
   - NACL → Allow + Deny.
   - SG → Only Allow.
3> Statefulness:
   - NACL → Stateless (need rules for both directions).
   - SG → Stateful (return traffic auto-allowed).
