=> EFS(Elastic File System):
---------------------------
-> Amazon EFS is managed by NFS(Network File System).
-> since, it is Network File System, we can mount EFS on many EC2 instance simultaneously.
-> These EC2 instances can reside in different availability zone.
-> EFS is highly scalable, but expensive.
-> The pricing model is pay per use.

=> Architecture and connectivity:
---------------------------------
-> you create an EFS file system and associate with any security group.
-> It can connect to many instances(in diff region) simultaneously.
-> This multi-AZ connectivity enables shared access across distributed instances.

=> Use:
---------
-> EFS provides scalable, elastic and shared file storage.
-> It allows multiple Amazon EC2 instances and other AWS compute resources to access and share the same file system concurrently.
-> EFS is designed for high throughput and low latency make it suitable for various workloads.

=> Use cases and compatibility:
-------------------------------
-> EFS is suitable for content management, web serving, data sharing, and application like workpress.
-> Internally it uses NFS(Network File System) protocol.
-> To control access we configure security groups with EFS.
-> It is important to note that EFS is only compatible with Linux-based AMIs and does not support Windows.
-> Encryption at rest can be enabled using aws KMS(Key Management Service).

=> Scalability and Pricing
--------------------------
-> Autoscale
-> pay per gigabyte of data used

=> Performance and Throughput Modes
------------------------------------
-> EFS support thousands of concurrent NFS client and can provide over 10 gigabytes per sec of throughput.
-> It can scale to petabyte levels automatically.

-> while creating EFS file system, we can choose the perfomance mode:
1> General purpose(default): Optimized for latency sensitive use cases such as web server and content management system.
2> Max I/O : Provides higher throughput with higher latency, suitable for big data and media processing applications due to 
             its high parallelism.

=> Throughput Modes:
--------------------
-> EFS offers different throughput mode:
1> Bursting:
-> Throughput scales with storage size.
-> for ex: with one terabyte of storage, we get 50 megabytes per sec plus bursts upto 100 megabytes per sec.

2> Provisioned:
->  Allows you to set throughput independently of storage size, such as one gigabyte per second for one terabyte of storage.

3> Elsatic:
-> automatically scale throughput up and down based on workload.
-> This mode is ideal for unpredictable workloads.

=> Storage Classes and Lifecycle Management:
--------------------------------------------
-> EFS provides several storage tiers with lifecycle management features to optimize cost:

1> Standard Tier: For frequently accessed files.
2> EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA): For files accessed less frequently, offering lower storage costs but with retrieval fees.
3> Archive Storage Tier: For rarely accessed data, such as files accessed only a few times per year, providing significant 
                         storage cost savings. Lifecycle policies can be configured to automatically move files between tiers 
                         based on the number of days since last access. For example, a file not accessed for 60 days in the 
                         Standard tier can be moved to the EFS-IA tier automatically.


Q> EFS vs EBS?
-> EBS volumes are attached to one instance at a time, except in the edge case of using multi attach feature of io1 and io2 
   types of volumes.
-> EBS volumes are attached to a single EC2 instance at a time and are locked to a specific availability zone(AZ).
-> EBS IO perfomance varies by volume type, with gp3 and io1 allowing independent scalling.
-> Migrating EBS volumes across AZs region requires creating and restoring snapshots.
-> EFS is a network file system designed to be shared across multiple instances and AZs, supporting POSIX and suitable for Linux.
-> EFS has a higher cost but offers storage tiers for cost savings.
