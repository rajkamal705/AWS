=> EBS volume:
-> EBS volume comes in 6 type:
   - gp2/gp3 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume that balance price and performance for wide variety of workloads.
   - io1 / io2 Block Express (SSD): Highest performance SSD volume for mission critical low latency or high throughput workloads.
   - st1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput intensive workloads.
   - sc1: Lowest-cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads.

=> Defining an EBS volume:
--------------------------
-> Several factors define an EBS volume, including size, throughput, and IOPS.
-> IOPS: Input/Output operation per second.
-> For EC2 instances, only gp2, gp3, io1 and io2 volumes can be used as boot volumes, meaning where the root operating system runs.

=> General purpose SSD volumes: gp2 and gp3:
--------------------------------------------
1> gp2:
-> cost effective storage with low latency.
-> suitable for system boot volumes, virtual desktops, development and test environment.
-> size range: 1GB to 1TB.

2> GP3: 
-> The newer generation of volume.
-> provides a baseline of 3000 IOPS and a throughput of 125 megabytes per sec.
-> IOPS can be increased upto 16000 and throughput upto 1000 megabytes per sec.

Note: smaller GP2 volumes can burst upto 3000 IOPS. Increasing the volume size increase IOPS at a rate of 3 IOPS per gigabytes.

=> Summary of gp2 and gp3
--------------------------
-> Both are cost effective storage options with low latency.
-> gp3 allows independent scaling of IOPS and throughput.
-> gp2 links volume size and IOPS together.

=> EBS multiattach:
-------------------
-> The multiattach feature of EBS volume enables attaching the same volume to multiple EC2 instance, within the same 
   availability zone.
-> This capability is available exclusively for the io1 and io2 families of EBS volumes.
-> Each instance attached to the volume has full read and write permissions to this high-performance volume. This means all
   instances can read and write concurrently.
-> The primary use case for Multi-Attach is to achieve higher application availability and  when your application manage 
   concurrent write operations.
-> Multi-Attach is restricted to a specified availability zone. It does not allow attaching an EBS volume from one 
   availability zone to another.
-> Up to 16 EC2 instances can attach to the same volume simultaneously. 
-> To use Multi-Attach effectively, you must use a cluster-aware file system.
