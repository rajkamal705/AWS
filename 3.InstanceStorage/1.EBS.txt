=> EBS (Elastic Block Store):
-> EBS is a network drive you can attach to your instances when they run.
-> It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination.
-> They can only be mounted to one instance at a time(at the CCP level).
-> They are bound to a specific availability zone.
-> Free tier: 30 GB free EBS storage.

=> More detail:
-> It's a network drive(not physical drive).
-> It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a latency a bit.
-> It can be detached with one instance and attached to other very quickly.
-> It is locked to single availability zone. To move a volume across, you have to snapshot it first.
-> Have a provisioned capacity: you can get billed for that. you can increase the capacity of the drive over time.
-> a single instance can attached with one or more EBS.

=> EBS -> Delete on termination attribute.
-> This shows that on deleting instance, EBS volume attached with that instances will also get deleted, if Delete on termination 
   is marked yes in that EBS volume.
-> attribute enabled or disabled is marked using checkbox.
-> useCase: preserve root volume when instance is terminated.

=> EBS snapshot:
-> Make a backup(snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time.
-> not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended.
-> can copy snapshots across AZ or Region.
ex: instance1: asia-a1(EBS 50gb) ------------> snapshot of EBS can connect across the region -----------> Instance2: asia a2(EBS 2gb)

=> EBS snapshot feature:
1> EBS snapshot Archive:
-> move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper.
-> Takes between 24hr to 72hr for restoring the archive.

2> Recycle bin for EBS snapshot:
-> deleted snapshot are sent to Recycle bin so that you can retrieve later(1day to 1 year).
-> It allows us to recover snapshot that i deleted accidently.

3> FSR(Fast snapshot Restore):
-> Forceful initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use.
