=> EBS (Elastic Block Store):
-> EBS is a network drive you can attach to your instances when they run.
-> It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination.
-> They can only be mounted to one instance at a time(at the CCP level).
-> They are bound to a specific availability zone.
-> Free tier: 30 GB free EBS storage.

=> More detail:
-> It's a network drive(not physical drive).
-> It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a latency a bit.
-> It can be detached with one instance and attached to other very quickly.
-> It is locked to single availability zone. To move a volume across, you have to snapshot it first.
-> Have a provisioned capacity: you can get billed for that. you can increase the capacity of the drive over time.
-> a single instance can attached with one or more EBS.

=> EBS -> Delete on termination attribute.
-> This shows that on deleting instance, EBS volume attached with that instances will also get deleted, if Delete on termination 
   is marked yes in that EBS volume.
-> attribute enabled or disabled is marked using checkbox.
-> useCase: preserve root volume when instance is terminated.

=> EBS snapshot:
-> Make a backup(snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time.
-> not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended.
-> can copy snapshots across AZ or Region.
ex: instance1: asia-a1(EBS 50gb) ------------> snapshot of EBS can connect across the region -----------> Instance2: asia a2(EBS 2gb)

=> EBS snapshot feature:
1> EBS snapshot Archive:
-> move a snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper.
-> Takes between 24hr to 72hr for restoring the archive.

2> Recycle bin for EBS snapshot:
-> deleted snapshot are sent to Recycle bin so that you can retrieve later(1day to 1 year).
-> It allows us to recover snapshot that i deleted accidently.

3> FSR(Fast snapshot Restore):
-> Forceful initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use.

=> EBS volume in detail:
----------------------------
=> Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) is a persistent block-level storage service by AWS that you attach to EC2 instances.
-> Think of EBS as a virtual hard disk that you attach to your EC2 (virtual computer) in the cloud.
-> Just like a real hard disk, it stores your operating system, applications, and data (files, databases, logs, etc.).

=> Where is it used?
-> It is used with EC2 instances to store data that:
- Persists beyond instance shutdowns
- Requires fast I/O performance
- Can be backed up using snapshots

=>  What can EBS store?
-> EBS volumes can store any kind of data:
- The OS of your instance (e.g., Linux, Windows)
- Installed software (e.g., Node.js, Java)
- Your project files (e.g., code, images)
- Databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
- Logs, backups, temporary files
- Anything you can store on a normal hard disk

Note: So, it’s just like C:/ or D:/ drive on your personal laptop — but in the cloud.

=> What is an EBS Snapshot?
-> A snapshot is like taking a photo/backup of your EBS volume.
- It’s stored in Amazon S3, not on your volume.

-> You can use it to:
- Backup your volume data
- Restore the volume if something breaks
- Create new volumes in the same or other regions
