=> AMI: Amazon machine image.
-> AMI are customization of an EC2 instance:
   1> you can add your own software, configuration,operating system, monitoring.
   2> Faster boot/configuration time bec all your package are pre-packaged.
-> AMI are built for specific region and (and can be copied across regions).
-> you can launch EC2 instance from:
   a> A public AMI: provided by aws 
   b> your own AMI: you can maintain by own.
   c> An aws marketplace AMI: an AMI made by someone else and potentially sold to someone.

=> AMI creation Process(from an EC2 instance):
-> start an EC2 instance and customize it.
-> stop the instance(for data integrity).
-> Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots behind the scene.
-> finally, we can Launch instances from other AMIs.
-> Suppose we created an EC2 instance in any particular region suppose eu-east-1a, so after customization of this EC2 instance, 
   you can create AMI from it. This will be our custom AMI. Then we can lauch the copy of that instance in other region,
   we can say eu-eash-1b.

=> Key Takeaways
-> An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) customizes EC2 instances by prepackaging software and configurations.
-> AMIs can be created by AWS, customized by users, or purchased from the AWS Marketplace.
-> Creating your own AMI results in faster boot and configuration times for EC2 instances.
-> AMIs can be region-specific but are copyable across AWS regions to leverage global infrastructure.
