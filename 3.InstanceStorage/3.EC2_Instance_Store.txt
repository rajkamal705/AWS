=> EC2 instance store:
-> EBS volumes are network drives with good but limited performance.
-> If you need a high performance hardware disk, use EC2 instance store.
-> EC2 instance store have:
   - Better I/O performance.
   - EC2 instance store lose their storage if they are stopped.
   - Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/ temporary content
   - Risk of data fail in hardware fails
   - Backups and Replication are your responsibility,

=> Appropriate Use Cases for EC2 Instance Store:
-> If you have a buffer, a cache, or you want to store scratch data or temporary content, this would be a great place to do so.
   However, it is not suitable for long-term storage. 
-> For long-term storage, Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a great option.
